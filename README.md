## How to add images

[UPLOAD PAGE HERE](https://github.com/alycejenni/lates/upload/main/images)

If that link doesn't work:
["images" folder](/images) > "Add file" button > "Upload files"

1. Upload any new images from this interface
2. Click "commit changes"
3. Wait for about a minute
4. The new pictures should appear on [the site](https://alycejenni.github.io/lates)

## Troubleshooting

If something went wrong, it's almost certainly in the [actions](https://github.com/alycejenni/lates/actions) (automated processes that rebuild/deploy the site when new things are uploaded).

- check the symbols:
  - yellow dots mean it's still processing
  - red crosses mean something went wrong and you'll probably have to ask Ginger
  - grey circles with exclamation marks mean it was skipped, which is _probably_ fine
  - green ticks are all good
- check the times on the right hand side:
  - if the latest one doesn't match up with when you uploaded the files (roughly), it may not have started running for some reason
  - wait until you upload something else, and if it doesn't work again then ask Ginger
